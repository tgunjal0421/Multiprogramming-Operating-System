# Multiprogramming Operating System (MOS) Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of a **Multiprogramming Operating System (MOS)** built in two phases.  
The project demonstrates how operating systems manage **job execution, memory, interrupts, and error handling**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Phase 1
- Job loading and execution.
- Instruction cycle simulation (Load, Store, Compare, Branch).
- Service interrupts:
  - **Read (GD)**
  - **Write (PD)**
  - **Terminate (H)**
- Sequential job execution (no multiprogramming).

### Phase 2
- **Paging and memory management** with Page Table Register (PTR).
- **Process Control Block (PCB)** implementation.
- Error handling and interrupts:
  - **Program Interrupts (PI):** Operation error, Operand error, Page fault.
  - **Time Interrupts (TI):** Time-limit exceeded.
  - **Service Interrupts (SI):** Input, Output, Halt.
- Address mapping (Virtual to Real).
- Error codes & termination messages.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MOS-Project.git
   cd MOS-Project
   ```
2. Navigate to phase1/ or phase2/ and run the respective code.

3. Provide input files in the required format ($AMJ, $DTA, $END control cards).

4. Outputs will be generated in the designated output file.

## 🧾 Example Input Format

Given in input.txt file for phase 1 and input2.txt file for phase 2.
Ref;
```bash
  $AMJ ...
  <Program Cards>
  $DTA
  <Data Cards>
  $END
```

## 📜 Error Codes

- 0 → No Error
- 1 → Out of Data
- 2 → Line Limit Exceeded
- 3 → Time Limit Exceeded
- 4 → Operation Code Error
- 5 → Operand Error
- 6 → Invalid Page Fault

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Understand the internal working of a simple Operating System.
- Learn about interrupt handling, job scheduling, memory paging, and error management.
- Develop structured thinking for system-level programming.
